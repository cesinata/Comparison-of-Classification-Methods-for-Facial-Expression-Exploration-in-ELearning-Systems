# Exploration of Facial Expression using Facial Landmark

---

This research project was made when i was a research student. The research was conducted on an e-learning with the aim of improving the quality of e-learning. The collected data is in the form of 68 facial landmarks along with the expressions detected from these facial landmarks. Besides that, there is also a page log data, a record of the pages that have been accessed by users of this e-learning. My task here is to analyze the facial expression data with EDA approach. Furthermore, I also did a comparison of machine learning performance to classify the facial landmark data into 7 facial expressions. The algorithms used are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Linear Support Vector Classifier (LSVC)

Note: Since the original data is sensitive, then the original data will not be published in this repository
